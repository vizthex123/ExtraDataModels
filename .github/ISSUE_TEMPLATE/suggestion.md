**What mod(s) should support be added for?**


<!--
Only these MC Versions are supported since that's what Hostile Neural Networks is on, so don't suggest version ports unless HNN is available for that version.

1.21.1
1.20.1
1.19.2
1.18.2/1

Anything below 1.18.2 won't be supported since legacy versions of HNN don't have the methods I need to add mod support.

Note that v1.5 is available on 1.17.1 if you really want to play that half-complete version for some reason: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models/files/5815592
