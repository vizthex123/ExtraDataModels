This datapack adds more Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) and tweaks some of the existing ones.

Should work on every version of the mod, but I've only tested it on 1.20.1 so far.

   
Designed for my tech modpack that's still in development.



 _**Trivia for all of them (the paragraph of text that appear in the Deep Learner) is in [the resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modded-data-models-trivia)!**_


_**Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/modded-data-models/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!**_


### Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the pack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

1a) If you want the trivia entries, download the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modded-data-models-trivia) as well.

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data`

3) Load your world and the new models will be added to it. If a mod isn't loaded, the model/loot/changes won't load in.

4) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

*Note: Most Ad Astra mobs are variants due to the lack of drops. Martian Raptors only give items from [Thermal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion) and/or [Alex's Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves)*

Loot Fabrication Support
========================

Changes to Default Models
-------------------------

_Mod support changes will link to the mod's CurseForge page._
_Note: They will not load in unless the require mod is present, so you don't need to have everything installed_

 

\- Adds a model for Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Skeleton Horses, and Zombie Horses

\- Several modded enemies are now variants for some default models (if the supported mod is loaded, of course)

\- Adds Eggs to the Chicken's fabricator drops

\- Adds [Dragon Scales](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) to the Ender Dragon's fabricator drops

\- Adds [Glow Squid Tentacles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeper-caves) to Glow Squids' fabricator drops

\- Adds [Hoglin Meat & Hides](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netherific) to Hoglin' fabricator drops (I recommend removing the default loot if you've got the mod installed).

\- Adds [Alpha Roses](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/regions-unexplored) to Iron Golems' fabricator drops

\- Removes Slime Blocks from Slimes' fabricator drops
