This datapack adds more Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) and tweaks some of the existing ones.

Designed for my [Hi-Tech Revolution](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution) modpack.

<br />

 ***Trivia for all of them (the paragraph of text that appear in the Deep Learner) is in [the resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia)!***

***Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!***

*Enjoy the pack? Send me a dollar or two on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/vizthex) or [Patreon!](https://patreon.com/vizthex)*

<br />

_Note: Since I made this for a 1.20 modpack, I'll start adding support starting on that version (but will still port and backport any changes I make - they just might take a bit longer to release)._

<br />

# Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the datapack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader). *If you want the trivia entries, download the latest version of the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia) as well*

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data`

3) **Optional:** Enable the trivia pack in the game's settings. ***If you downloaded it manually, you can place it into `config/openloader/resources` and it will auto-enable itself.***

4) **Optional:** Load your world and check one of the models from the datapack to view its trivia entry. ***If the datapack isn't loaded, this resource pack won't do anything!***

5) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just override the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything. ***Same applies for manually updating the resource pack.***

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack)

# Mod Support

_Mod support only loads in if the mod(s) are also loaded into the game, so you don't need to install all of these mods._

<br />

_Note: Most Ad Astra mobs are variants due to the lack of drops. Martian Raptors only give items from [Thermal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion) and/or [Alex's Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves) if either mod is installed._



## Changes to Default Models

<br />

- Several modded enemies are now variants for some default models (if the supported mod is loaded, of course)

- A few models now support some modded drops (such as the [Ender Dragon](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/data-pack/1.20/data/hostilenetworks/data_models/ender_dragon.json)). *For a full list, you can view the [source files](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/tree/main/data-pack).*

- Adds a model for Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Skeleton Horses, Zombie Horses, and more!

- Adds Eggs to the Chicken's fabricator drops

- Adds [Dragon Scales](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) & more to the Ender Dragon's fabricator drops

- Adds [Glow Squid Tentacles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeper-caves) to Glow Squids' fabricator drops

- Adds [Hoglin Meat & Hides](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netherific) to Hoglin' fabricator drops (I recommend removing the default loot if you've got the mod installed).

- Adds [Alpha Roses](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/regions-unexplored) to Iron Golems' fabricator drops

- Removes Slime Blocks from the Slimes' fabricator drops
