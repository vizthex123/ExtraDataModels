This datapack adds more Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) and tweaks some of the existing ones.

Designed for my [Hi-Tech Revolution](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution) modpack.



 ***Trivia for all of them (the paragraph of text that appear in the Deep Learner) is in [the resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modded-data-models-trivia)!***

***Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/modded-data-models/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!***



### Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the pack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

1a) *If you want the trivia entries, download the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modded-data-models-trivia) as well.*

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data` and resource pack into `config/openloader/resources`

3) Load your world and the new models will be added to it. If a mod isn't loaded, the model/loot/changes won't load in.

4) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack)

# Mod Support

_Mod support only loads in if the mod(s) are also loaded into the game, so you don't need to install everything._

<br/>

_Note: Most Ad Astra mobs are variants due to the lack of drops. Martian Raptors only give items from [Thermal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion) and/or [Alex's Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves) if either mod is installed._



Changes to Default Models
-------------------------

*Mod support changes will link to the mod's CurseForge page.* <br/>
*Note: They will not load in unless the require mod is present, so you don't need to have everything installed*

<br/>

- Several modded enemies are now variants for some default models (if the supported mod is loaded, of course)
- A few models now support some modded drops (such as the [Ender Dragon](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/data-pack/1.20/data/hostilenetworks/data_models/ender_dragon.json))
- Adds a model for Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Skeleton Horses, and Zombie Horses (Llamas and Turtles were added in v1.4)
- Adds Eggs to the Chicken's fabricator drops
- Adds [Dragon Scales](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) to the Ender Dragon's fabricator drops
- Adds [Glow Squid Tentacles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deeper-caves) to Glow Squids' fabricator drops
- Adds [Hoglin Meat & Hides](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netherific) to Hoglin' fabricator drops (I recommend removing the default loot if you've got the mod installed).
- Adds [Alpha Roses](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/regions-unexplored) to Iron Golems' fabricator drops
- Removes Slime Blocks from Slimes' fabricator drops
