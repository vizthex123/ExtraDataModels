# _This does nothing on its own! It's an add-on for my [mod support datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/extra-data-models)!_


Adds trivia lines to my mod support datapack for [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks).



Each model has their own trivia entry (examples in the [gallery tab](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fast-better-grass/gallery) that shows up when the model is inserted in a Deep Learner.



Also fixes the names of a couple of enemies that aren't properly localized.

 

_**Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!**_

 

### Installation Instructions

1) Downloading the [datapack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/modded-data-models), then get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

2) Place the resource pack into `config/openloader/resources`

3) Load your world and trivia will be added to it. _If the datapack isn't loaded, this resource pack won't do anything!_

4) When updating the resource pack, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.
