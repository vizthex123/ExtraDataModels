This datapack adds more Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) and tweaks some of the existing ones.

Designed for my [Hi-Tech Revolution](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution) modpack.

<br />

_**Also includes trivia for all of them (the paragraph of text that appear in the Deep Learner) if you install the resource pack! Grab it alongside the [regular download](https://modrinth.com/datapack/extra-data-models/versions).**_

<br />

_**Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!**_

<br />

### Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the pack, get [Open Loader](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader). *If you want the trivia entries, download the [resource pack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/extra-data-models/versions) as well. It's attached to every version, and works across all supported Minecraft versions.*

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data` and resource pack into `config/openloader/resources`

3) Load your world and the new models will be added to it. If a mod isn't loaded, the model/loot/changes won't load in.

4) When updating either one, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://modrinth.com/mod/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack)

# Mod Support
_Mod support only loads in if the mod(s) are also loaded into the game, so you don't need to install everything._

<br/>

*Note: Most Ad Astra mobs are variants due to the lack of drops. Martian Raptors only give items from [Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) and/or [Alex's Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-caves) if either mod is installed.*

## Changes to Default Models

_Mod support changes will link to the mod's CurseForge page._
_Note: They will not load in unless the require mod is present, so you don't need to have everything installed_

- Several modded enemies are now variants for some default models (if the supported mod is loaded, of course)

- A few models now support some modded drops (such as the [Ender Dragon](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/data-pack/1.20/data/hostilenetworks/data_models/ender_dragon.json))

- Adds a model for Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Skeleton Horses, and Zombie Horses (Llamas and Turtles were added in v1.4)

- Adds Eggs to the Chicken's fabricator drops

- Adds [Glow Squid Tentacles](https://modrinth.com/mod/deeper_caves) to Glow Squids' fabricator drops

- Adds [Hoglin Meat & Hides](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netherific) to Hoglin' fabricator drops (I recommend removing the default loot if you've got the mod installed).

- Adds [Alpha Roses](https://modrinth.com/mod/regions-unexplored) to Iron Golems' fabricator drops

- Removes Slime Blocks from the Slimes' fabricator drops
