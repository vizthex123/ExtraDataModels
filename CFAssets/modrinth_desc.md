This datapack adds more Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks) and tweaks some of the existing ones.
 

If you find any issues, crashes, or just want to suggest some mods to add, head over to the issue tracker.

   
Designed for my tech modpack that's still in development.


 _**Also includes trivia for all of them (the paragraph of text that appear in the Deep Learner) if you install the resource pack! Grab it alongside the [regular download](https://modrinth.com/datapack/extra-data-models/versions).**_


**_Suggest mods I should add support for in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/issues), or on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X)!_**



### Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the pack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

1a) If you want the trivia entries, download the [resource pack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/extra-data-models/versions) as well.

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data` and resource pack into `config/openloader/resources`

3) Load your world and the new models will be added to it. If a mod isn't loaded, the model/loot/changes won't load in.

4) When updating either one, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://modrinth.com/mod/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack)



Mod Support
===========
_Mod support only loads in if the mod(s) are also loaded into the game, so you don't need to install everything._

*Note: Most Ad Astra mobs are variants due to the lack of drops. Martian Raptors only give items from [Thermal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion) and/or [Alex's Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves)*

Loot Fabrication Support
========================

Changes to Default Models
-------------------------

_Mod support changes will link to the mod's CurseForge page._
_Note: They will not load in unless the require mod is present, so you don't need to have everything installed_
 

- Adds a model for Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Skeleton Horses, and Zombie Horses

- Several modded enemies are now variants for some default models (if the supported mod is loaded, of course)

- Adds Eggs to the Chicken's fabricator drops

- Adds [Dragon Scales](https://modrinth.com/mod/quark) to the Ender Dragon's fabricator drops

- Adds [Glow Squid Tentacles](https://modrinth.com/mod/deeper_caves) to Glow Squids' fabricator drops

- Adds [Hoglin Meat & Hides](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netherific) to Hoglin' fabricator drops (I recommend removing the default loot if you've got the mod installed).

- Adds [Alpha Roses](https://modrinth.com/mod/regions-unexplored) to Iron Golems' fabricator drops

- Removes Slime Blocks from Slimes' fabricator drops
