_This does nothing on its own! It's an add-on for my [mod support datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/modded-data-models)!_

<br />
Adds trivia lines to my mod support datapack for [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks).


<br />
Each model has their own trivia entry (examples in the [images tab](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modded-data-models-trivia/screenshots)) that shows up when the model is inserted in a Deep Learner.

<br />
Also fixes the names of a couple of enemies that aren't properly localized.

### Installation Instructions

1) Download the [data pack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/modded-data-models), then get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader)

2) Place the resource pack into `config/openloader/resources` and data pack into `config/openloader/data`

3) Load your world and trivia will be added to it. _If the datapack isn't loaded, this resource pack won't do anything!_

4) When updating either of them, repeat step 2 - just overrride the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack)
