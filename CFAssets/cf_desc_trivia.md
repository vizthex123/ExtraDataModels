_This does nothing on its own! It's an add-on for my [mod support datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models)!_
================================================================================================================================================

Adds trivia lines to my [mod support datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) for [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks).

Each model has their own trivia entry (examples in the [images tab](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia/screenshots)) that shows up when the model is inserted in a Deep Learner.

Also fixes the names of a couple of enemies that aren't properly localized.

### Installation Instructions

1) Download the [datapack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models), then get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader)

2) Place the data pack into `config/openloader/data`

3) **Optional:** Enable the trivia pack in the game's settings. _**If you downloaded it manually, you can place it into `config/openloader/resources` and it will auto-enable itself.**_

4) **Optional:** Load your world and check one of the models from the datapack to view its trivia entry. _**If the datapack isn't loaded, this resource pack won't do anything!**_

5) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just override the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything. _**Same applies for manually updating the resource pack.**_

If you downloaded the trivia pack through a launcher, just enable it in-game (and make sure it's [enabled by default](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/default-options) if you plan to publish your modpack).
