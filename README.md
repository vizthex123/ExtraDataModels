Hosts the files for my [datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) that adds extra Data Models to [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks).

Also hosts the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia) that adds trivia to them all, and the assets for all 3 project pages.

Designed for my [Hi-Tech Revolution](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution) modpack.
