Another thanks goes to the handful of people who have suggested mods I should add support for (you can find a full list in the changelog: https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/changelog_data.md).


And lastly, a big thank-you to the developers of all the mods I added support for. Can't add modded models if there's no mods to add models for lol.

And a big shout-out to the Minecraft Wiki. I found out about supported_formats from it, saving me a great headache (if only the game auto-replaced the pack format so it didn't whine about a version mismatch)...
