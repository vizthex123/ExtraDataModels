Lines prefixed with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.

[v1.3]
Added trivia for modded mobs added in v1.4 of the datapack

Added trivia for Glow Squids [Upgrade Aquatic]
Added trivia for Chorus Squids [The Outer End]
Added trivia for the Wrapped [Quark]

Changed the trivia entry for Giant Squids [Aquatic Frontiers]
Changed the name for the Immortal Jellyfish [Upgrade Aquatic]
- Since all 3 variants share a model, the model is now called "Jellyfish"


--------------------
[v1.2.1]
Now uses `supported_formats`, so I only have to update a single version (and it'll be less spammy to find the one for the MC version you're on)
- Note that the game will whine about it being for "a newer version of Minecraft", but it will work fine

In addition, I've archived all the old versions to make the file list more readable.


--------------------
[v1.2]
Tweaked the wording for the Thrasher's trivia
Added trivia for the following mobs:
- Entombed [Outer End]
- Spectrafly [Outer End]
- [1.20] Star Crawler [Ad Astra]


--------------------
[v1.1]
