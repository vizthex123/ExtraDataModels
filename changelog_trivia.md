# Trivia Pack Changelog

A full changelog for every version of the [Trivia Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support (except when I don't lol - it's pretty arbitrary tbh), and X.X.1 for minor tweaks and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

## v1.6.1

Renamed the following mobs' keys, meaning their trivia won't load unless you're running v2.0 of the datapack:
- Giant Squid and Sponge Squid *[Aquatic Frontiers]*

*I try to avoid changing the trivia keys since it breaks backwards compatability, but I had to make these two fit my standards.*

*There's no reason not to update both packs at the same time though, but you can avoid going past v1.6 of the Trivia Pack and v1.5 of the Data Pack if you really don't want the changes (for whatever reason).*

Fixed a typo in the Kangaroo's trivia entry *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
Fixed the trivia entry for the Bone Serpent not loading *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
Renamed Quark's Oretoise to Toretoise
- I swear it used to be called that since it's a good pun

Added trivia entries for the following:
- Fallen Knight *[Ender Zoology]*
- Wither Skeleton Knight *[Bygone Nether]*
- Wraither *[Bygone Nether]*

Tweaked the following trivia entries:

- Since all 3 variants share a model, the model is now called "Jellyfish"


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v1.2.1

Now uses the `supported_formats` field, so I only have to update a single version (and it'll be less spammy to find the one for the MC version you're on)
- Note that the game will whine about it being for "a newer version of Minecraft", but it will still work fine

In addition, I've archived all the old versions to make the file list more readable.
