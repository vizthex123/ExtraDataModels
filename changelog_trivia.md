# Trivia Pack Changelog

A full changelog for every version of the [Trivia Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by .1 whenever I add more mod support.

- Glow Squids [Upgrade Aquatic]

Changed the trivia entry for Giant Squids [Aquatic Frontiers]
Changed the name for the Immortal Jellyfish [Upgrade Aquatic]
- Since all 3 variants share a model, the model is now called "Jellyfish"

--------------------------------------------------
## 1.2.1

Now uses the `supported_formats` field, so I only have to update a single version (and it'll be less spammy to find the one for the MC version you're on)
- Note that the game will whine about it being for "a newer version of Minecraft", but it will work fine

In addition, I've archived all the old versions to make the file list more readable.


--------------------------------------------------
## 1.2

Tweaked the wording for the Thrasher's trivia

Added trivia for the following mobs:
- Entombed [Outer End]
