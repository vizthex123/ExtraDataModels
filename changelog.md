# Data pack

[v1.3.1]
Fixed the Squirrel and Gloomoth models not loading

	[1.19 Only]
	Fixed all my custom variants not loading
	Fixed the Phantom model not loading

	[1.18 Only]
	Backported to 1.18.X

	Removed Aquatic Frontiers and Ender Zoology support
	Removed my Sheep changes since Ad Astra isn't on this version
	Fixed a few models not loading because I formatted things wrong
	Other changes from the 1.19 version

	[1.17 Only]
	Backported to 1.17.1

	Removed all mod support since nobody uses this version
	- I figured I'd publish it anyway since it does tweak a couple of the default models, and maybe somebody's playing this half-finished MC version for god knows what reason and wants to use this datapack.

	I don't know if this will even work (HNN wants Placebo v5.0.3 but it seems like that doesn't exist), so hopefully it does lol

# Trivia pack

[1.2.1]
Now uses `supported_formats`, so I only have to update a single version (and it'll be less spammy to find the one for the MC version you're on)
- Note that the game will whine about it being for "a newer version of Minecraft", but it will work fine

In addition, I've archived all the old versions to make the file list more readable.

--------------------
[1.2]
Tweaked the wording for the Thrasher's trivia
Added trivia for the following mobs:
- Entombed [Outer End]
- Spectrafly [Outer End]
- [1.20] Star Crawler [Ad Astra]


--------------------
[1.1]
Tweaked the trivia entries for a few mobs
Added trivia for Upgrade Aquatic's mobs

	[1.19]
	Backported to 1.19.2

	Removed Alex's Caves trivia since the mod isn't on this version
	Added trivia for Camels [Ecologics]
