# Data pack

[v1.4]
[1.20] Fixed the pack format being wrong (don't think it changes anything, but it might prevent some random issues in the future)
Changed the colour for the Luxtructosaurus

Increased the Scrap Metal (8 -> 16) and Copper Ingot (16 -> 64) outputs for the Hullbreaker
- Also changed the order so things are grouped together better
Removed extra matrix costs from all models
- These were only meant for my [new modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution), and not intended for the public release

Added a data model for Llamas
Added a data model for Turtles
The Evoker model now gives 1 Totem of Undying (was 2)
Reduced the amount of Ink Sacs given by Giant Squids [Aquatic Frontiers]

Added support for the following mods (suggested by AntiMidas in the comments section):

Alex's Mobs [1.20]
Friends & Foes [All versions] - Moobloom is a cow variant
Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks [1.18+]
Tetra [All versions, drops only] - Adds fabricator drops to the Ender Dragon

--------------------
[v1.3.1]
Fixed the Squirrel and Gloomoth models not loading

	[1.19 Only]
	Fixed all my custom variants not loading
	Fixed the Phantom model not loading

	[1.18 Only]

	Fixed a few models not loading because I formatted things wrong
	Other changes from the 1.19 version

	[1.17 Only]
	Backported to 1.17.1

	Removed all mod support since nobody uses this version
	- I figured I'd publish it anyway since it does tweak a couple of the default models, and maybe somebody's playing this half-finished MC version for god knows what reason and wants to use this datapack.

	I don't know if this will even work (HNN wants Placebo v5.0.3 but it seems like that doesn't exist), so hopefully it does lol

--------------------

# Trivia pack

[1.3]

Added trivia for modded mobs added in v1.4 of the datapack

Added trivia for Glow Squids [Upgrade Aquatic]
Added trivia for Chorus Squids [The Outer End] 
Added trivia for the Wrapped [Quark] 

--------------------
[1.2.1]
Now uses `supported_formats`, so I only have to update a single version (and it'll be less spammy to find the one for the MC version you're on)
- Note that the game will whine about it being for "a newer version of Minecraft", but it will work fine

In addition, I've archived all the old versions to make the file list more readable.
