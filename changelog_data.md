# Datapack Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [Data Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support (so long as the addition has 8+ models), and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.

Reduced the RF cost of Cave Guardians *[Alex's Caves]*
- This refers to the boss of each cave (e.g. Hullbreaker and the Gum Worm)
- Increased the fabricator amounts for several of them

Reduced the output amounts of special items from Cave Guardians *[Alex's Caves]*
- This refers to the unique drops they have (such as the Sweet Tooth and Pure Darkness)

<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v2.0

*This is a massive update, and I'm hoping y'all enjoy it. I've gone back and checked on every model in the pack, so everything should be up-to-standard with all random issues/incorrectness fixed.*

Overhauled a lot of backend stuff
- Doesn't really affect players, but it does make development a bit easier

Re-balanced the Stoneling's loot once again *[Quark]*<br />
Fixed several models giving the wrong generalized predictions<br />
All Ad Astra models now give End Predictions instead of Overworld<br />
Added models for the following mobs:
- Bee (suggested by Tyler489 on the Hostile Neural Networks discord server)
- Ravager
- Pillager
- Vindicator


Wraiths now give 4 of each Ectoplasm (from all the supported mods) *[Quark]*<br />

Changed the Wither to give Nether Predictions and require less data per tier<br />
The Goose is no longer a Chicken variant *[Upgrade Aquatic]*<br />
Removed End Crystals from Enderman models

Reduced the render size of the Bone Serpent, Bunfugus, and Guster *[Alex's Mobs]*


Added a separate model for the Wither Skeleton Knight and Wraither *[Bygone Nether]*

- Previously, it was a Zombie and Skeleton variant


Added support for the following mods:
- Aquamirae
- Biome Makeover
- Bygone Nether
- Deep Dark: Regrowth

<br />

### v2.0 - 1.20 only

Reduced the Mimicube's Ferrouslimeball output to 4 (was 8) *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
Marauder Pillagers (Cowboys) now have their own model *[Biome Makeover]*

Rebalanced almost every Alex's Caves model based on my [new standards](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/standards.md#AlexsCaves)
- The various references I sometimes make do override this standard though (which applies to every model)
- The old scaling for standard enemies was 4/8/16/24 kills to max a model
- The old scaling for bosses was 2/3/4/5 kills to max a model
- There's too many to list, but a few of the ones I changed before deciding to do an overhaul are listed below

<br />

Removed Feathers from the Subterranodon's drops<br />
Halved the Dinosaur Chop drops of all the Primordial Grotto mobs<br />
Added the Atlatitan's loot to the Luxtructosaurus
- It give a bit less while costing more RF (since it's a boss), but makes the model a tad more useful

Tweaked a few models from Alex's Caves:
- Brainiac now uses 256 RF/t (was 128)
- Teletor now uses 192 RF/t (was 128)
- Notor now uses 92 RF/t (was 64)

Adjusted the Hullbreaker's model
- Tweaked data rates
- Increased the Sea Glass Shard output to 32 (was 8)
- Moved the model preview upwards a bit so it's more centered

Tweaked the drops of the Deep One model
- Removed Gold Nuggets and increased Raw Gold to 3 (was 1)
- Tweaked the order so things are grouped together a bit better

<br />

### v2.0 - 1.18/19 only

*[1.19]* Added support for The Endergetic Expansion<br />
*[1.18]* Fixed a bug that prevented some models from loading even though they should load in

Fixed the Elder Guardian's (and Guardian's) loot amounts not matching the 1.20 version<br />
Martian Raptors now give more Sulfur (8 instead of 4) and fewer Slimeballs (4 instead of 8) <br />
Removed the Endergrade model since The Outer End isn't on these versions

Reduced the Golden Moth's output to 8 Gold Nuggets (was 2 Ingots) *[Aquamirae]*<br />
Fixed the Illusioner, Iceologer, and Great Thraser models not loading on 1.18.X *[Friends & Foes] [Upgrade Aquatic]*<br />
Evokers, Pillagers, and Vindicators give Illager Flesh if [Food Enhancements](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/food-enhancements) is installed


**Unfixable issue:**

[1.18] Sheep models won't load in, and I can't fix it unless I separate both versions again (and I don't want to since it's annoying to maintain).

If (for whatever reason) you're playing on 1.18, you can manually remove `sheep.json` from the datapack.


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v1.6

*This entire update is only for 1.21 since a guy asked for extra mod support almost a week ago. Figured I'd take a break from developing v2.0 and add this real quick.*

Fixed the Illusioner's name not being localized

Added support for Eternal Starlight (suggested by MrEizy on the Hostile Neural Networks discord server)<br />
Reduced the amount of Netherite Scrap Ancient Knights give *[Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks]*

Imported the following changes from v2.0:

- Added a model for the Bee, Ravager, Pillager, and Vindicator
- The Bee model was suggested by Tyler489 on the Hostile Neural Networks discord server


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v1.5

*This is the first version with multi-version support for Minecraft!*

*As it says in the support tags, this version will work on MC 1.19.2 and 1.18.X. All future version for these two Minecraft version will follow suit.*

Reduced the Rattlesnake's Rattle output to 8 (was 16) *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
* [1.20]* Fixed the Void Worm's model trying to give an item that didn't exist *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
Fixed the scaling for the Laviathan, Moose, and Warped Mosco *[Alex's Mobs]*<br />
Reverted the Phantom's text colour back to the default (`#0AB405`)<br />
Ender Zoology models now give the correct predictions

Reduced the amount of Netherite Scrap Ancient Knights give *[Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks]*<br />
The Dead King's data model now requires far fewer kills to level up
- Also resized it so he fits into the preview window

Added support for the following mods:
- Ice & Fire (suggested by TravHan2009 in the comments section)
- *[1.18 and 1.20]* YUNG's Cave Biomes

<br />

### v1.5 - 1.21 only

Ported to 1.21.1

Most mod support has been removed for now, but I'll re-do it all as they do get ported (gonna be *so fun* to change the handful of lines that are different in all 300 files :D)

Added a model for the Breeze<br />
The Bogged is now a Skeleton variant

<br />

### v1.5 - 1.17 only

Dropped support for 1.17.1

*I hate having to drop support for a version people might play, but my test instance won't load and I can't fix it. In addition to this, all the mods I support either dropped support for (or entirely skipped) 1.17 since it's a half-baked version - so it's not that big of a loss imo. If you want to keep using this datapack, I would suggest moving your modpack to 1.18.2 or later if you can do so.*

All changes from v1.5, excluding the following:
- Scaling fixes - Didn't affect 1.17 since none of the mods exist
- Void worm fix - Was only on 1.20
- Random mod fixes - The mods aren't on this version
- Support for YUNG's Cave Biomes - Mod isn't on this version

Added models for the Sheep, Pig, Cow, Squid, and Glow Squid
- They're identical to the models on newer versions, but without the optional fabricator drops (since this version of the mod doesn't have that system)
- The Sheep has an off-white name label instead of the customized rainbow one

Standardized the file formatting
- Entirely a backend change, but it allows anyone modify things easier if they want to (and lets me make new models more efficiently)


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v1.4

*[1.20]* Fixed the pack format being wrong (I don't think it affects anything, but it bothers me if it's wrong)<br />
Changed the colour for the Luxtructosaurus

Increased the Scrap Metal (8 -> 16) and Copper Ingot (16 -> 64) outputs for the Hullbreaker
- Also changed the order so things are grouped together better
Removed extra matrix costs from all models

Added a data model for Llamas<br />
Added a data model for Turtles<br />
The Evoker model now gives 1 Totem of Undying (was 2)<br />
Reduced the amount of Ink Sacs given by Giant Squids *[Aquatic Frontiers]*

<br />

### v1.3.1 - 1.17 only

Backported to 1.17.1

Removed all mod support since nobody uses this version
- I figured I'd publish it anyway since it does tweak a couple of the default models, and maybe somebody's playing this half-finished MC version for god knows what reason and wants to use this datapack.

I don't know if this will even work (HNN wants Placebo v5.0.3, but it seems like that doesn't exist), so hopefully it's fine lol
