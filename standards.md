# Standards

A list of standards I want to enforce when updating either pack.


## Both

- Increment the version by .1 whenever I add more mod support.



## Data

- Standard indents I like
- Capitalized hex codes that start with #
- Modloading condition on the top, with the mod ID below it
- Folder names match the mod IDs formatting (shortened if needed)
- Make sure the fabricator order is minecraft -> modded stuff (unless the primary drop is a mod item)



## Trivia

- Add new trivia to the English translation (copied from Simplified English) and replace words with their proper spelling (e.g. "armour" instead of "armor")
