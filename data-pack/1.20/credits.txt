Contributors:
- The handful of people who have suggested mods I should add support for (you can find a full list in the changelog: https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/changelog_data.md).
- trav90 (Ice & Fire support)
- Synclet (support for Ars Nouveau, Bosses of Mass Destruction, Draconic Evolution, Mekanism Additions, and MythicBotany)



And a big shout-out to the Minecraft Wiki for documenting all the pointless pack format changes Mojang makes:

And lastly, a big thank-you to the developers of all the mods I added support for. Can't add modded models if there's no mods to add models for lol.
