1958 - The year Brainiac debuted (in Action Comics #242)

Tier data:

## Tarantula Hawk Wasp

<br />

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Bosses of Mass Destruction

## Nether Gauntlet

The data requirement of 1998 is a reference to Ocarina of Time's release date (since it's a giant hand with an eye, and as far as I can tell it was the first game in the series to introduce a "hand with eye"-style boss). The final line in its trivia entry alludes to that type of boss from the series.

<br />

## Night Lich

Its trivia entry references the Lich from [The Twilight Forest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest).

<br />

# Cloud Storage

<br />

# Deep Dark: Regrowth

Fun fact: All of the trivia entries for this mod use [l33t sp34k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). I wanted it to seem like the Sculk was talking to you without having to try and use a fancy font or different language or whatever, so I settled on leet speak.

As for why some of them just have a single line appended to the end, my headcanon for the trivia is that it was gathered by some other guy in the past who just observed each creature - but the Sculk's semi-sentience it broke through some entries, with more powerful Sculk creatures being able to fully take over (those are the fully leet speak entries, meant to be the Sculk's stream of consciousness).

I also like to think that the Sculk is a hive mind. Just kinda fits imo (and living hive mind environments are really cool but super underutilised in fiction, so I might as well shove my own version into minecraft lol).

<br />

## Abomination

Tier data:

1911 - References the year on Edward's watch in Fullmetal Alchemist. Since he & Alphonse made an alchemical abomination, I figured it'd make a good reference here

<br />

## Annihilator

Tier data:

9 - The letter-to-number for "i"<br />
1473 - The last half of "exterminate" in leet speak<br />
7347 - "Threat" in leet speak<br />
7373 - Part of "detected" in leet speak

This can be shuffled around to get "I [will] exterminate the [detected] threat", in reference to the trivia entry I wrote for the Annihilator.

<br />

## Observer

Tier data:

61 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion for "you"<br />
373 - "Eye" in leet speak<br />
533 - "See" in leet speak<br />
5733 - Most of "Steve" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "I see you, Steve", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.

<br />

## Sculk Parasite

Also includes the Corrupted Skeleton since they've both got identical data values.

Tier data:

118 - The Caves & Cliffs (part 2 lol) version number, which the Deep Dark was intended to be added with.

<br />

## Spreader

Tier data:

1357 - Combination of M's letter-to-number conversion and the last half of "must" in leet speak<br />
1633 - Combination of P's letter-to-number conversion and the middle part of "keep" in leet speak<br />
3419 - Last two sections of "spreading" in leet speak<br />
5235 - Two sections of "spores" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "must keep spreading spores", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.

<br />

## Stalker

Tier data:

61 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion for "you"<br />
373 - "Eye" in leet speak<br />
4719 - The numberical parts of "watching" in leet speak<br />
5733 - "Steve" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "I'm watching you, Steve", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Ecologics

## Camel

References the fact that the mod added them before vanilla did, as well as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

<br />

## Coconut Crab

The theory that Coconut Crabs ate Amelia Earhart.

<br />

## Penguin

# Enemy Expansion

## Equestrian

Its trivia entry references the ending of the [season 10 comic arc](https://equestripedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Season_10) of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic

## Ladybug

Its trivia entry references the 1998 movie [A Bug's life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug's_Life). One of the supporting characters (Francis) is a ladybug who's part of the travelling circus.

## Scorpion

Its trivia entry references the [Glyphid Stingtail](https://deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Glyphid_Stingtail) from Deep Rock Galactic.

## Vampire

Its trivia entry is a light reference to one version of [Morbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbius) that drained plasma instead of blood due to censorship (I think from the 90's Spider-Man cartoon?)

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Environmental

## Duck

Part 1 of the [duck song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q) series of YouTube videos, as well as the infamous [Lemon Rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLUU3O4zW8) from Portal 2.

<br />

## Koi

The ending of season 1 of Avatar: The Last Airbender (where Iroh threatens Zhao)

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Galosphere

## Berserker

Tier data:

11 - Number of years since [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Berserk/comments/2aw7jj/the_number_216_and_berserk/?rdt=42504) was made (that's how I found out about 216 being important)<br />
216 - Apparently an important number in Berserk (haven't read it yet), as it's "how often [the Eclipse](https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Eclipse) happens"<br />
1989 - Berserk's original publishing date<br />
2016 - Year the anime adapation came out (or at least one of them?), which everyone vehemantly hates

Since it's the *Berserk*er, I figured I'd reference the popular manga. Could probably do better if I read it, though...

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

## Ice and Fire: Dragons

## Cyclops

Homer's *[Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey)*

<br />

## Hippogryph

<br />

## Hydra
The [Lernaean Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra) from the myth of Heracles (Hercules).

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Iron's Spells

## Dead King

Tier data:

700 - Death date for [Ivar Vidfamne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Vidfamne), who is the oldest know Danish king (as far as I can find, at least). The only numbers related to him are his death year and the dates archeological excavations happened<br />
1014 - [Æthelred the Unready's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethelred_the_Unready) reign begins. CGP Grey's [video about the British Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgP6d9HraI) starts with the next guy, so this is a very loose reference to it<br />
2551 - [Khufu's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu) reign begins. He orders the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, and did a lot more stuff<br />
3170 - [Iry-Hor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iry-Hor) reign begins. As far as I can tell, he's the first monarch we know of

At first, I wanted to reference the years of the first rules for multiple countries - but most countries are thousands of years old, which didn't fit with the scaling I like to do for Data Models

My original plan was to reference multiple rulers of varying countries, but I'm not a historian and finding semi-reliable info about something as vague as "who was the first king/pharoh/other synonym" is pretty hard lol - so I settled for two from Egypt and two from Europe.

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Naturalist

## Bass

The fact that both "bass" and "bass" are pronounced differently despite being different things. You could also extend this to [Bass](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Bass) from the Mega Man games (his name was mispronounced in the dub of one of the games iirc), but idc about that series and only thought of it whilst writing this sentence.

## Boar

The [Asterix comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix).

## Canary

The old idiom of a "[canary in a coal mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species#Canaries)", as well as the fact that the miners would take care of the birds and attempt to retrieve them if the mine collapsed or anything.

## Rhino

Rhino from Marvel's Spider-Man.

## Robin

Refers to DC's Batman & Robin.

## Zebra

Its trivia entry references is an incredibly forced reference to [Zecora](https://equestripedia.org/wiki/Zecora_(Friendship_is_Magic)) from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. She lives in the Everfree Forest, brews potions, and always speaks in [rhyming couplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet).




--------------------------------------------------

<br />

# Quark

## Forgotten

Tier data:

1874 - Year Howard Carter was born. He would later go on to discover King Tutankhamun's tomb<br />
1922 - King Tutankhamun's tomb is discovered. Keeping with the Indiana Jones theme, I figured I'd reference this oft-quoted discovery<br />
1981 - Year the first Indiana Jones movie released. Seems like the mob is a reference to the character, so I figured I'd do the same<br />
2023 - Year the last(?) Indiana Jones movie released

<br />

## Stoneling

Tier data:

1 - EMC value of Stone in the Equivalent Exchange mods (ProjectE is a fork of EE2)<br />
