# References to other media

I've made so many references that I lost track lmao. Might as well make this list while I work on v2.0. Hope I can remember them all lol.

# Alex's Caves

### Deep One

RF rate: 113 - Update Aquatic version number. Still salty they added the phantom instead of that cool water creature... it was the *aquatic* update, man! Come on...

Tier data:

12 - Number of appearances the Deep Ones make in lovecraft's work (including the extended universe)
102 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion of Y'ha-nthlei, which is the only named city of the Deep Ones
1936 - Release date of [The Shadow Over Innsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_over_Innsmouth)
2011 - Release date of the [lovecraft complete fiction](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/sources/hplcf.aspx)


### Hullbreaker

RF rate: 1872 - year the first scientific ocean voyage started

Tier data:

304 - Date the Reaper Levithans [were added](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Update_History_(Subnautica)#Crash_Site_Update) to Subnautica (in the DD/MM format)
1960 - First visit to Mariana's Trench

2009 - Year the creeper was added to minecraft



# Deep Dark: Regrowth

Fun fact: All of the trivia entries for this mod use [l33t sp34k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). I wanted it to seem like the Sculk was talking to you without having to try and use a fancy font or different language or whatever, so I settled on leet speak.

As for why some of them just have a single line appended to the end, my headcanon for the trivia is that it was gathered by some other guy in the past who just observed each creature, but due to the Sculk's semi-sentience it broke through some entries, with more powerful Sculk creatures being able to fully take over (those are the fully leet speak entries, meant to be the Sculk's stream of consciousness).

I also like to think that the Sculk is a hive mind. Just kinda fits imo.

## Warden

The Warden isn't part of the mod, but I changed it in Capitalia: Inward Expansion so it'd match the other Deep Dark enemies.

19 - References The Wild Update (1.19), which added the Deep Dark
65 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion of "Warden"
118 - The Caves & Cliffs (part 2 lol) version number, which the Deep Dark was intended to be added with.


### Abomination

Tier data:

1911 - References the year on Edward's watch in Fullmetal Alchemist. Since he & Alphonse made an alchemical abomination, I figured it'd make a good reference here.


### Annihilator

Tier data:

9 - The letter-to-number for "i"
1473 - The last half of "exterminate" in leet speak
7347 - "Threat" in leet speak
7373 - Part of "detected" in leet speak

This can be shuffled around to get "I [will] exterminate the [detected] threat", in reference to the trivia entry I wrote for the Annihilator.


### Observer

Tier data:

61 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion for "you"
373 - "Eye" in leet speak
533 - "See" in leet speak
5733 - Most of "Steve" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "I see you, Steve", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.


### Sculk Parasite

Also includes the Corrupted Skeleton since they've both got identical data values.

Tier data:

118 - The Caves & Cliffs (part 2 lol) version number, which the Deep Dark was intended to be added with.


### Spreader

Tier data:

1357 - Combination of M's letter-to-number conversion and the last half of "must" in leet speak
1633 - Combination of P's letter-to-number conversion and the middle part of "keep" in leet speak
3419 - Last two sections of "spreading" in leet speak
5235 - Two sections of "spores" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "must keep spreading spores", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.


### Stalker

Tier data:

61 - Sum of the letter-to-number conversion for "you"
373 - "Eye" in leet speak
4719 - The numberical parts of "watching" in leet speak
5733 - "Steve" in leet speak

So the entire thing is meant to spell out "I'm watching you, Steve", but I had to swap a few things around to make it follow the scaling numbers data models use.


# Galosphere

### Berserker

Tier data:

10 - Number of years since [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Berserk/comments/2aw7jj/the_number_216_and_berserk/?rdt=42504) was made (that's how I found out about 216 being important)
216 - Apparently an important number in Berserk (haven't read it yet), as it's "how often the Eclipse happens"
1989 - Berserk's original publishing date
2016 - Year the anime adapation came out (or at least one of them?), which everyone vehemantly hates

Since it's the *Berserk*er, I figured I'd reference the popular manga. Could probably do better if I read it though...



# Iron's Spells

### Dead King

Tier data:

700 - Death date for [Ivar Vidfamne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Vidfamne), who is the oldest know Danish king (as far as I can find, at least). The only numbers related to him are his death year the dates archeological excavations happened.
1014 - [Ã†thelred the Unready's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgP6d9HraI) reign begins. CGP Grey's video about the British Crown starts with the next guy, so this is a very loose reference to it.
2551 - [Khufu's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu) reign begins. He orders the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, and did a lot more stuff.
3170 - [Iry-Hor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iry-Hor) reign begins. As far as I can tell, he's the first monarch we know of.

At first, I wanted to reference the years of the first rules for multiple countries - but most countries are thousands of years old, which didn't fit with the scaling I like to do for Data Models

My original plan was to reference multiple rulers of varying countries, but I'm not a historian and finding semi-reliable info about something as vague as "who was the first king/pharoh/other synonym" is pretty hard lol.

So, I settled on two from Egypt and two from Britian.



# Quark

### Forgotten

1874 - Year Howard Carter was born. He would later go on to discover King Tutankhamun's tomb 
1922 - King Tutankhamun's tomb is discovered. Keeping with the Indiana Jones theme, I figured I'd reference this oft-quoted discovery.
1981 - Year the first Indiana Jones movie released. Seems like the mob is a reference to the character, so I figured I'd do the same.
2023 - Year the last(?) Indiana Jones movie released.
