[1.0]
	[1.16 Only]
	Backported to 1.16.5

	Added a model for the Chorus Squid [The Outer End]
	Added a model for the Wrapped [Quark]

	This version doesn't support optional loot, so I removed it all
	This version doesn't support variants, so the following were converted into models instead of variants (with the same loot pool):
	- Husk
	- Stray
	- Zoglin
	- Glow Squids are now part of Upgrade Aquatic's mod support
	- Goose and Flare [Upgrade Aquatic]
	
	I'm never gonna update this version lmao
	Seriously, don't play on 1.16.
