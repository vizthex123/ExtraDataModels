# Data notes

Contains some dev notes about the datapack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bygone Nether

Each Wither Skeleton models gets +64 RF and +8 to its drops (only +2/4 for the mod compat ones). Knights and Corpors also give more Skulls.

## Ender Zoology

Ender variants use Â±64 RF/t (based on their size) to make each mob's model feel a bit more unique than just "you get slightly different loot compared to vanilla"
- Each one gives less vanilla loot, but has extra modded drops (including default compat)
