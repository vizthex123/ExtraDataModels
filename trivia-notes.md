## Deep Dark: Regrowth

Sculk entries never use contractions, and are always pluralized. Uses l33t $p3@k to denote that it's not whoever wrote all the trivia entries (increments by 1 level per line).
- A few level 3 entries are modified to remove backslashes so the trivia pack can load
- Galm creatures aren't plurarized
